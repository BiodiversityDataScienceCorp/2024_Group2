Species: Little Brown Bat?

## Our Favorite Species:

### Calvin:

My favorite species is Phylum Cnidaria. Growing up my family and I would visit the different beaches along the East Coast and every so often I would find a "Jellyfish" washed ashore. One summer day, I made the mistake of touching a Jellyfish despite the numerous warnings I got from my family. The decision of doing so was painful, but since them I've learned to appreciate their defensive attritubes and colorful features.

### Olivia's favorite species

My favorite species is a giraffe, specifically a reticulated giraffe (Giraffa reticulata). I love their size, their slow nature, and their patterns. I just think they are beautiful animals, especially with their long eyelashes.
