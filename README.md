My favorite species is Phylum Cnidaria. Growing up my family and I would visit the different beaches along the East Coast and every so often I would find a "Jellyfish" washed ashore. One summer day, I made the mistake of touching a Jellyfish despite the numerous warnings I got from my family. The decision of doing so was painful, but since them I've learned to appreciate their defensive attritubes and colorful features.
