Species: Little Brown Bat (*Myotis lucifugis*)

## Our Favorite Species:

### Calvin:

My favorite species is Phylum Cnidaria. Growing up my family and I would visit the different beaches along the East Coast and every so often I would find a "Jellyfish" washed ashore. One summer day, I made the mistake of touching a Jellyfish despite the numerous warnings I got from my family. The decision of doing so was painful, but since them I've learned to appreciate their defensive attritubes and colorful features.

### Olivia's favorite species

My favorite species is a giraffe, specifically a reticulated giraffe (Giraffa reticulata). I love their size, their slow nature, and their patterns. I just think they are beautiful animals, especially with their long eyelashes. 

### Antonio:

My favorite animal is the Pacific treefrog. (Pseudacris Regilla) I grew up around a pond in rural Washington where during the summer, I would constantly hear hundreds or thousands of them making their noise. Which I have grown to love. 


### Mairin:

My favorite species right now is *Eustala anastera*, it is a beautiful species of orb weaver spider. They are found throughout the Americas, but *E. anastera* is the only species of *Eustala* that has been recorded in the literature as present in Oregon. They are colloquially referred to as the "hump-backed orb-weaver" for their unique ridges or "humps" on their abdomen. *E. anastera* come in many color variations. My favorite is the stunning green & yellow that mimics forest foliage.
